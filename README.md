# tdd-practice

## Aim:
Practice Test Driven Development (TDD) using Jest.

## Tests conducted on:
1. A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.
2. A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.
3. A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.
4. A caesarCipher function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.
5. An analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: average, min, max, and length.
